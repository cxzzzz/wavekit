## Unreleased

## v0.6.1 - 2026-05-23

### Fixed
- Fix wheel packaging for Cython reader extensions so installed wheels expose `wavekit.readers.value_change` and FSDB extension modules at their runtime import paths.

## v0.6.0 - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Add `FstReader` for loading FST waveform files through the same reader APIs as VCD and FSDB.
- Add `Channel`-based FIFO consumption to Pattern matching for ordered request/response pairing and per-ID routing.
- Add relative time access helpers for waveform analysis.
- Add Chinese README documentation.

### Changed
- Refactor the pattern API around tick, channel, capture mode, and require semantics.
- Improve VCD reader error reporting for empty value-change data and unsupported sub-range access.

### Fixed
- Fix FSDB array signal value parsing and reader resource handling.
- Restrict pattern trigger optimization to `wait()` steps.
