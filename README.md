# wavekit

This is a Python library for manipulating and analyzing digital circuit waveforms. The library provides tools to read, process, and perform various operations on waveform data, suitable for various digital circuit simulation and testing scenarios.

## Features
* Read various waveform file formats (e.g., VCD, FSDB, etc.)
* Batch extraction of waveforms using absolute paths, brace expansions and regular expressions
* Perform arithmetic operations, bitwise operations, functional operations and other operators on waveform data

## Installation
You can install the library using pip:

``` bash
pip install wavekit
```

## Quick Start
Here is a simple example demonstrating how to use the library to read a VCD file and perform some operations on the waveform data:

``` python
```
